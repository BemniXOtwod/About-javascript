About javascript

concept-
JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc

variable- 
A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable. There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers). Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
var num; //declaration
num=2; //initialization 

datatype-
In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null.
let x = 16 + "Volvo";
let num;           // Now x is undefined
num = 5;           // Now x is a Number
num = "Bemnet";      // Now x is a String

conditional statement-
In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements: Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true. Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false. Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.

if (date == 1) {
  month = "January";
} else if (date == 2) {
  month = "Feburary";
} else {
  month = "I do not know";
}

loops-
Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false . A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false 
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}

methods-
JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties.

dom-
The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents: "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

events-
An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
Here are some examples of HTML events:
-An HTML web page has finished loading
-An HTML input field was changed
-An HTML button was clicked
